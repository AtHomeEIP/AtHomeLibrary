   * - A dimmable LED could set it's percentage of brightness corresponding to
   * the value (for example 1 = 100%, 5 = 50%, 10 = 0%)
   * - A 7 segments display could display the digit itself and stay off at 10
   * - An LCD screen could write a sentence, the digit, draw a gauge, ...etc
   * - A speaker or buzzer could do noise of different intensities below 6
   * - ...etc
