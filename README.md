# WoodBox Development Kit

This repository holds the source code of the WoodBox Development Kit (Framework + examples + PCBs and schematics).

## What is WoodBox?

WoodBox is a set of smart devices enabling to monitor a house's environment and the possible effects on human health. A smartphone application communicating with sensing devices put into the house, enable the user to get advices, tips and solutions to potential problems, and to communicate with other members of WoodBox community, to be able to live better at home.

## Installation and requirements to use this kit:

This development kit requires some external libraries to be present on your environment. If you use Arduino, just download these into your "libraries" folder into your "Arduino" directory.

In the same way, to use this development kit, just download this repository in your "libraries" folder. Once all libraries are downloaded, just open the "Library manager" in the Arduino IDE for it to update your libraries list.

Usual locations of Arduino directory:
- Windows: Documents\Arduino
- Linux: ~/Arduino (ie, in your home folder)
- OS X: ~/Arduino (ie, in your home folder)

Libraries required:
- Partial Arduino Core implementing interfaces Print, Printable and Stream -> Used for generic interfaces and avoid duplicates between Arduino and non-Arduino projects
